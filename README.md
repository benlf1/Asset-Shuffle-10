# Asset Shuffle 10
 
Welcome to the 10th Asset Shuffle! This week's theme: One Button.

This asset shuffle will be an exercise on how to make games with one button input like many mobile games (i.e. Flappy Bird).

This Asset Shuffle consists of the following assets:  
- [Sprite Pack #1 - Tap and Fly](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/sprite-pack-1-tap-and-fly-21454)
- [2D Pixel Art - Deep Caves 16x16](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/2d-pixel-art-deep-caves-16x16-195205)
- [Warped Space Shooter](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/warped-space-shooter-181590)

The preset code consists of a simple script that lets the player jump with the left mouse button.

The pack was built in Unity version **2019.4.25f1 (LTS)**.

Have fun!
